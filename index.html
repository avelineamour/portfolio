          <h1>bio</h1>
          <p>Boston native full stack web developer and entrepreneur with a passion for UI/UX design and code. Problem solver by nature. My unique area of expertise is connecting aesthetic with functionality. Though front end design was my first love, the back end has quickly become my second. I greatly enjoy the engineering process and would like to see more female engineers in the tech industry. So for starters, I am being the change I want to see. <br /><br />
          I am passionate about designing elegant and minimalist mobile responsive websites. I build from scratch with HTML, css, & Sass. My most recent project, a Sinatra web application, utilizes RESTful routes and ActiveRecord, allowing for creation and modification of user data. At the time of writing, I am learning Ruby on Rails and thereafter progressing to JavaScript, at which point I will be incorporating JS/React into my web development.<br /><br />
          ðŸŒžI am using this opportunity to move to sunny & warm Los Angeles. For a long time I've wanted to live in southern California and it means a lot to me on a personal level both in terms of health and happiness. For that reason I am seeking either remote work or work in Los Angeles. There are great reasons for both. I function best in laidback environments where there is positive communication and trust. It is in that kind of environment that I am to contribute most.
